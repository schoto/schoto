<!--
**schoto/schoto** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on simple projects with HTML/CSS/JS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning also C# to better understand the basics of programming
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like Lipton Ice Tea
